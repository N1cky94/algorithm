# Algorithm

Algorithm is my aproach to an array of questions that need an algorithm to be solved.
Most questions can be answered by pure math, but in this project, we strive to provide a correct answer by code and make sure that we keep on receiving a correct answer, when parameters shuold change.

Algorithm is split into a couple of categories like math, ...
These categories are split into subcategories like math/prime, math/fibonacci, ...

A new release, will always provide an answer to a new question. Most questions come from [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net/).

## Approach

This project is a pure Java project that focusses on my aproach to solve a problem by code.
The code is written in a way that it can be used in a production environment, but it is not the main goal.
The main goal is to provide a correct answer to a question and to make sure that the answer is still correct when parameters change.
Clean Code is used to clean up the code, and reuse parts later on.
The testing suite will test my algorithms as well as test for the correct answer to the problem.

### Development and Versions
This code is my personal approach to solving problems. There for I will not be using branches in the beginning. 
This might change over time.

The development cycles are based on specific problems, and when a solution to a problem has been found, that commit will be provided with a tag.
For example, the solution to problem 15 on project Euler is found, it gets the tag: ***Euler15***.

## Development

Currently, the following categories are available:
- math

Currently, the following Euler questions are answered (The last element is the one in production or just produced):
1. [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
2.
