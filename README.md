# Algorithm

Algorithm is my aproach to an array of questions that need an algorithm to be solved.
Most questions can be answered by pure math, but in this project, we strive to provide a correct answer by code and make sure that we keep on receiving a correct answer, when parameters shuold change.

Algorithm is split into a couple of categories like math, ...
These categories are split into subcategories like math/prime, math/fibonacci, ...

A new release, will allways provide an answer to a new question. Most questions come from [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net/).

Currently, the following categories are available:
- math

Currently, the following Euler questions are answered (The last element is the one in production or just produced):
1. [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
2.
